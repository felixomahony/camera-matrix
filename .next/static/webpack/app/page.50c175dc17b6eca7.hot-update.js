The tilde over the points x and y indicate that these are in homogeneous coordinates.

This requires a transformation from world to camera coordinates."},{"type":"text","data":"There are two components to the transformation of points from a world coordinate system to a camera coordinate system: rotation and translation."}]},{"title":"Extrinsics: Translation","content":[{"type":"text","data":"Crucially, here we need to think about the location of points now in the coordinate system of the camera."},{"type":"text","data":"Suppose that we have a point in the world, pᵥᵥ, and we wish to know where it is in the camera coordinate system.

We just add our translation vector, T, to the location of our point p, right?"},{"type":"text","data":"Not so fast. Recall that we are working in the camera coordinate system. The location of p is given in world coordinates. We still need to rotate the point into the camera coordinate system. However, this is fairly simple. We simply find the rotation matrix R which rotates points from the world coordinate system to the camera system."},{"type":"text","data":"Practically speaking, this is given by the orientation of the world axes when viewed in the camera coordinate system.

However, in reality we typically set the location and rotation of the camera in the world coordinate system, not the other way around."},{"type":"text","data":"Fortunately, the two matrices are separated by a simple inverse operation.
